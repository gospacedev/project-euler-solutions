# project-euler-solutions

I am solving the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems for fun and as a way to learn programming in a mathematical perspective.

The solutions written in Go are in a module format to avoid creating a folder for every solution. There are also solutions written in C++, Java, and Python.
